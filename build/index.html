            <li tabindex="0">
              <h3>Who is the organizer? Duration of programs?</h3>
              <p>The organizer is the Masa Agency, which is a project of the Government of Israel and the Jewish Agency
                "Sokhnut", whose task is to support long-term programs in Israel. The goal of the project is to
                facilitate the annual stay in Israel of thousands of young people aged 18 to 30 from the Diaspora
                countries within the framework of various long-term programs lasting from 1 semester to a year.</p>
            </li>
            <li tabindex="0">
              <h3>What is a Study Grant?</h3>
              <p>The Masa Grant is the main mean through which the Jewish Agency "Sokhnut" and the Government of Israel
                intend to achieve the goal of the project. Masa Company is a subsidiary of the Jewish Agency, created
                for the implementation of projects and issuing grants (for residents of the CIS and Baltic countries) in
                accordance with the duration of the program and its cost.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="faq-visible-li" tabindex="0">
              <h3>How is the cost of the program determined?</h3>
              <p class="faq-visible">The total cost is determined by the organizers, depending on the direction. In most
                cases, the Masa grant does not cover the full cost of the program, and therefore a certain amount of
                personal participation is provided.</p>

                intend to achieve the goal of the project. Masa Company is a subsidiary of the Jewish Agency, created

              <h3>Is the study recognized in the project for further study?</h3>
              <p>Universities in Israel and Western countries recognize academic studies in the framework of the Masa
                project if the organizer claims the academic accreditation of his program. The situation in the CIS is
                more complicated, and the recognition of education depends, as a rule, on the decision of each
                individual educational institution. Find out in advance at your school whether your studies under the
                Masa project will be recognized, or whether you will be able to obtain such accreditation upon your
                return from Israel. The Masa Project Management is not responsible for academic accreditation. Only the
                organizer of the curriculum is responsible for this.</p>

            <li tabindex="0">
              <h3>What the complete registration process looks like<br>for the Masa program?</h3>
              <p>Your actions:
                Program selection.
                Contact the coordinator of the selected program and register for a consular check.
                Filling out a questionnaire on the Masa website.
                Upload documents on the successful completion of consular checks on the participants' portal through
                your personal account.
                Obtaining an A2 student visa at the consulate based on a letter from Masa about the approved grant.

                  <q>Teaching in Israel so far has truly been a life changing experience. Looking back on my journey so
                    far, I cannot believe just how much I have grown in such a short period of time. The cliche really
                    is true: I think I have learned more from my students then I have been able to teach them. Everyday,
                    I am challenged by why I experience both in and out of the classroom: from a child's question about
                    Italian to learning about the issues facing Israeli Bedouins.</q>
                  <br>
                  <q>As I am immersed into my students' culture, my eyes are opened to a totally different way to
                    viewing and experiencing the world. It is this everyday experience with my students that has truly
                    shaped and changed me as a person - for the better</q>
